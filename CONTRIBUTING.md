# How to contribute

The way to contribute is to open an issue and start a discussion on [main repo issue tracker](https://github.com/alekshura/SourceMapper/issues)
Then we can decide if and how a feature or a change could be implemented and if you should submit a pull requests with code changes.

I recommend to read firs: [Being a good open source citizen](https://hackernoon.com/being-a-good-open-source-citizen-9060d0ab9732#.x3hocgw85)

## Bugs and feature requests?
Please create a new issue in the main GitHub repo:

* [SourceMapper](https://github.com/alekshura/SourceMapper/issues), tag it as a `bug` or `enhancement`

## Filing issues
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal project with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

## Contributing code and content
You will need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org/) before submitting your pull request.

Make sure you can build the code. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. 
If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

**Only PRs to the master branch are accepted.**

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the author and ensure it follows the product roadmap. 

Here's a few things you should always do when making changes to the code base:

**Commit/Pull Request Format**

```
Summary of the changes (Less than 80 chars)
 - Detail 1
 - Detail 2

#bugnumber (in this specific format)
```

**Tests**

-  Tests and also unit or integration tests need to be provided and written for every bug/feature that is completed.
-  All unit or integration tests should pass
