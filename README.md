# SourceMapper

# Introduction
`SourceMapper` is a mappers code generator based on attributes. 
It is based on .NetCore [Source Generators](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/source-generators.md) 
engine and generates classes for mappers during build time of you project.
That is the main difference between `SourceMapper` and [Automapper](https://automapper.org/): you can see the generated code after app build process.
